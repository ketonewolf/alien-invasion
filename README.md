# alien-invasion
Let’s build a game called Alien Invasion!
We’ll use Pygame, a collection of fun, powerful 
Python modules that manage graphics,
animation, and even sound, making it easier
for you to build sophisticated games. With Pygame
handling tasks like drawing images to the screen, you
can focus on the higher-level logic of game dynamics.
